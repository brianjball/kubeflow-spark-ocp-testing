This example is designed to run with the spark-examples.jar application. In order to get this, download Spark itself (see line 3 of `build.sh`), and the jar is in `examples/jars` in the `tgz` file.

In your `pvc.yaml` file, use whichever RWX PVC class you have available.


If you need to, make sure you give the running service account permissions to pull the custom image:

kind: ClusterRoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: spark-image-pulling
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: spark-operator-spark
    namespace: default
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: 'system:image-puller'
