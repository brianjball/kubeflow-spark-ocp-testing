This example is designed to run with the the included project. `app.py` is the main script, and there are dependencies in mypackage that run on both the driver and executor nodes to demonstrate how you can manage your project.

kind: ClusterRoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: spark-image-pulling
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: spark-operator-spark
    namespace: default
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: 'system:image-puller'
